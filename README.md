View and interact with remote automated vehicles

This project implements a cross platform multi-touch enabled application for the purpose of interacting with multiple autonomous vehicles. This project was initiated as a major project at QUT by James Jenner as part of James' masters course.

The software is designed to leverage html5, css3 and javascript for the purposes of code reuse and reduce the cost.

An implementation using phone gap can be built that allows the software to run as a native application under iOS and Android based devices.
